            </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Chris Thile - Mandolin and Lead Vocals</li>
            <li>Gabe Witcher - Violin</li>
            <li>Noam Pikelny - Banjo</li>

            <li>All members provide back up vocals!</li>
        </ul>
            <p>I saw this band perform live with my Father at one of 
                Dallas' most historical venues: 
                The Majestic theatre.  
                <br>
                The lead singer and Mandolin Player also has an amazing 
                show on NPR that features some great music and comedy.  
                <br>
                The show is now called "Live From Here" and was formerly 
                "Prarie Home companion."  This is a great show for the whole family!

                </h3>
            <p>
                The Band has an entertaining back story, and went through multiple 
                names before being called "The Punch Brothers." 
                <br>

                for the detailed and referenced information.
                The group started out with just Thile and Witcher as the primary 
                members, but eventually grew into a 5 piece bluegrass fusion band.  <br>
                They play very virtuostically and really remind the listener of what 
                Nashville Music is all about.  
                <br>
                Stories and Love and all the feelings that go with human expression 
                can be felt in their music.
