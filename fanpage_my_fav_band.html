            <p>I saw this band perform live with my Father at one of 
                Dallas' most historical venues: 
                The Majestic theatre.  
                <br>
                The lead singer and Mandolin Player also has an amazing 
                show on NPR that features some great music and comedy.  
                <br>
                The show is now called "Live From Here" and was formerly 
                "Prarie Home companion."  This is a great show for the whole family!

                For the detailed and referenced information.
                The group started out with just Thile and Witcher as the primary 
                members, but eventually grew into a 5 piece bluegrass fusion band.  <br>
                They play very virtuostically and really remind the listener of what 
                Nashville Music is all about.

                Stories and Love and all the feelings that go with human expression 
                can be felt in their music.
